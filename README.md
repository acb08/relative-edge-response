# relative-edge-response

Code used to study the relationship between Gaussian blur and relative edge response (RER). The basic work flow is to (1) generate blur kernels using build_blur_kernel_set.py, (2) create an edge chip dataset using build_edge_dataset.py, (3) measure the RER using the slanted edge method in measure.py, and (4) visualize the results using assess.py.
